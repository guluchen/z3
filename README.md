[2]: #building-z3-using-make-and-gccclang
[3]: #building-z3-using-cmake
[4]: #z3-bindings

## Building Z3-Trau using Cmake
Create a new folder and use cmake to build Z3-Trau
```
git checkout new_trau (in case you clone the entire project)
mkdir trau-build
cd trau-build
cmake ../
make
```

## Running Z3-Trau 
Try 
```
./z3 smt.string_solver=trau dump_models=true ../benchmarks/Leetcode/addBinary/4a22d6d9c959560f70ab4b2a6065fc377a5402487ae4c5eae36c3f54.smt2
```

A successful execution should give you the following result:
sat
(model
  (define-fun b () String
    "")
  (define-fun a () String
    " ")
)
